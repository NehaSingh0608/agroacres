                <p align="justify">Fertilizers are chemical substances supplied to the crops to increase their
                    productivity. These are used by the farmers daily to increase the crop yield. The fertilizers
                    contain the essential nutrients required by the plants, including nitrogen, potassium, and
                    phosphorus. They enhance the water retention capacity of the soil and also increase its fertility.

                </div>
                <p align="justify">There are six different types of fertilizers that are mentioned below:</p>
                <h3>Inorganic Fertilizers</h3>
                <p align="justify">Inorganic fertilizers are chemical fertilizers that contain nutrient elements for the
                    growth of crops made by chemical means. The inorganic fertilizers are of the following types:</p>
                <h4>Nitrogen Fertilizers</h4>
                <p align="justify">Nitrogen fertilizers contain nitrogen necessary for the development of crops.
                    Nitrogen is the main constituent of chlorophyll that maintains a balance in the process of
                    photosynthesis. It is also a part of amino acids in plants and constitutes protein. Nitrogen
                    fertilizers improve the production and quality of agricultural products.</p>
                <h4>Phosphorus Fertilizer</h4>
                <p align="justify">The main nutrient in a phosphorus fertilizer is phosphorus. The efficiency of
                    fertilizer depends upon effective phosphorus content, methods of fertilizing, properties of soil and
                    crop strains. Phosphorus found in the protoplasm of the cell plays an important role in cell growth
                    and proliferation. The phosphorus fertilizer is beneficial for the growth of roots of the plants.
                </p>
                <h3>Organic Fertilizers</h3>
                <p align="justify">Organic fertilizers are natural fertilizers obtained from plants and animals. It
                    enriches the soil with carbonic compounds essential for plant growth. Organic fertilizers increase
                    the organic matter content of the soil, promotes the reproduction of microorganisms, and changes the
                    physical and chemical properties of the soil. It is considered to be one of the main nutrients for
                    green food.</p>
                <p align="justify">Organic fertilizers can be obtained from the following products:</p>

                    <h2>Importance of Fertilizers</h2>
                </div>
                <p align="justify">It is very difficult to meet the demands of the increasing population with such fewer
                    resources. Loss of soil fertility, pests, and lack of nutrients has resulted in a decrease in
                    agricultural production. This has increased the importance of fertilizers in agriculture.</p>
                <p align="justify">Fertilizers can be important to the plants in the following ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p align="justify">Fertilizers increase plantsâ€™ tolerance towards pests. This has reduced their
                            reliance on insecticides and herbicides, thereby, producing healthier crops. Consequently,
                            diseases have reduced, providing aesthetic value to the crops.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p align="justify">Fertilizers improve the water holding capacity of the plants and increase
                            root depth.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p align="justify">The potassium content present in the fertilizers strengthens the straws and
                            stalks of the plants.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p align="justify">The phosphorus present in the fertilizers helps in the faster development of
                            roots and formation of seeds in the plants.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p align="justify">Nitrogen in the fertilizers enhances the growth of the plants which can be
                            characterized by the green colour of the plants.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p align="justify">Since the chemical fertilizers adversely affect soil fertility, biofertilizers were brought into use. These
                    are substances that contain living or latent cells, and even micro-organisms. They provide the soil
                    with the necessary nutrients and microbes for the growth of the plants. They help the soil to retain
                    its fertility. They are environment-friendly and also destroy pathogenic components responsible for
                    causing disease in plants. Acetobacter and Rhizobium are two such widely used biofertilizers.</p>
