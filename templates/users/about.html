                <h3><span class="italic"><strong>Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian Economy"- said Mahatma
                        Gandhi.</strong></span><br></h3>
                Even today, the situation is still the same,
                with almost the entire economy being sustained by agriculture, which is the mainstay
                of the villages. It contributes 16% of the overall GDP and accounts for employment
                of approximately 52% of the Indian population. Rapid growth in agriculture is essential
                not only for self-reliance but also to earn valuable foreign exchange.
                <br>

                Indian farmers are second to none in production and productivity despite of the
                fact that millions are marginal and small farmers. They adopt improved agriculture
                technology as efficiently as farmers in developed countries. It is felt that with
                provision of timely and adequate inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and
                by making available affordable agricultural credit /crop insurance, Indian farmers
                are going to ensure food and nutritional security to the Nation.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
                It is envisaged to make available relevant information and services to the farming
                community and private sector through the use of information and communication technologies. Farmers’
                Portal is an endeavour in this direction to create one stop shop for meeting all
                informational needs relating to Agriculture of an Indian farmer. With this Indian Farmer will not be
                required to sift through maze of websites created for specific purposes.</p>
            <p class="para">
                Once in the Farmers’ Portal, a farmer will be able to get all relevant information
                on specific subjects around his village/block /district or state. Also they can sell and buy seed for their crops. Farmers will also be able to ask
                specific queries as well
                as give valuable feedback through the Feedback module specially developed for the
                purpose.
